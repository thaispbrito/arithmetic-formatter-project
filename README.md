# arithmetic-formatter-project  
This is a Python project built for the [freeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).  
It formats arithmetic problems vertically and side-by-side, simulating how students arrange problems to make them easier to solve.

## Features

- Format up to five arithmetic problems  
- Supports addition and subtraction operations  
- Validates operators and operand lengths  
- Returns meaningful error messages for invalid input  
- Optionally displays the answers to the problems  
- Aligns numbers and operators for clear readability  

## Project Structure

- arithmetic_formatter_project.py: Main Python module containing the `arithmetic_arranger` function and logic  
- README.md: Project documentation  
- output.txt: Sample output based on test cases for the `arithmetic_arranger` function
